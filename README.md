# Adam Shepherd - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Adam! I have an analytical background in Accounting and Finance and currently. I have developed a strong foundation in the world of data and have a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist. 

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

My CV in [pdf](.........).

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
